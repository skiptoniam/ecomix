ecomix is a package to implement statistical models on multivariate species data. Two main type of finite mixture models are available which either model at species level (Species Archetype Models) or site level (Region of Common Profile). 

#### Installation

<!-- `ecomix` version 1.0.0 can be install from cran using `install.package("ecomix")`. -->

The `ecomix` development can be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package: 

```{r install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github('skiptoniam/ecomix')
library(ecomix)
```

An example vignette on how to run and interpret a Species Archetype Models (species_mix) is provided within the package or can be viewed at https://skiptoniam.github.io/ecomix/articles/SAM-example.html

An example vignette on how to run and interpret a Region of Common Profiles model (regional_mix) is provided with the package or can be viewed at https://skiptoniam.github.io/ecomix/articles/RCP-example.html
