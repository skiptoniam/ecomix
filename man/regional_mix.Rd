\arguments{
\item{rcp_formula}{an object of class "formula" (or an object that can be coerced to that class).
The response variable (left hand side of the formula) needs to be either 'presence', 'occurrence', 'abundance', 'biomass' or 'quantity' this will help specify the type of data to be modelled, if the response variable is disperate to the model distribution an error will be thrown. The dependent variables (the right hind side) of this formula specifies the dependence of the region of common profile (rcp) probabilities on covariates.}

\item{species_formula}{an object of class "formula" (or an object that can be coerced to that class). The left hand side of this formula should be left empty (it is removed if it is not empty). The right hand side of this formula specifies the dependence of the species"'" data on covariates (typically different covariates to \code{rcp_formula} to avoid confusing confounding). An example formula is observations ~ gear_type + time_of_day, where gear_type describes the different sampling gears and time_of_day describes the time of the sample. #maybe could call this detection/bias}

\item{data}{a List which contains named objects 'species_data': a data frame containing the species information. The frame is arranged so that each row is a site and each column is a species. Species names should be included as column names otherwise numbers from 1:S are assigned. And 'covariate_data' a data frame containng the covariate data for each site. Names of columns must match that given in \code{rcp_formula} and \code{species_formula}.}

\item{nRCP}{The number of mixing components (groups) to fit.}

\item{distribution}{The family of statistical distribution to use within the ecomix models. a  choice between "bernoulli", "poisson", "negative_binomial" and "gaussian" distributions are possible and applicable to specific types of data.}

\item{offset}{a numeric vector of length nrow( data) that is included into the model as an offset. It is included into the conditional part of the model where conditioning is performed on the unobserved RCP type. Note that offsets cannot be included as part of the rcp_formula or species_formula arguments ??? only through this argument.}

\item{weights}{a numeric vector of length nrow( data) that is used as weights in the log-likelihood calculations. If NULL (default) then all weights are assumed to be identically 1.}

\item{control}{a list of control parameters for optimisation and calculation. See details. From \code{control} control.}

\item{inits}{a characture string which defines the method used to initialise finite mixture model clustering. #Will have to synergise this function call across RCP and SpeciesMix. Looks like SpeciesMix uses a em.prefit to setup initialisations. regional_mix has a number of methods. This seems like a good place to setup the bivariate clusting step - cobra function.}

\item{titbits}{either a boolean or a vector of characters. If TRUE (default for regimix(qv)), then some objects used in the estimation of the model"'"s parameters are returned in a list entitled "titbits" in the model object. Some functions, for example plot.regimix(qv) and predict.regimix(qv), will require some or all of these pieces of information. If titbits=FALSE (default for regimix.multifit(qv)), then an empty list is returned. If a character vector, then just those objects are returned. Possible values are:"Y" for the outcome matrix, "X" for the model matrix for the RCP model, "W" for the model matrix for the species-specific model, "offset" for the offset in the model, "wts" for the model weights, "form.RCP" for the formula for the RCPs, "form.spp" for the formula for the species-specific model, "control" for the control arguments used in model fitting, "dist" for the conditional distribution of the species data, and "power" for the power parameters used (only used in Tweedie models). Care needs to be taken when using titbits=TRUE in regimix.multifit(qv) calls as titbits is created for EACH OF THE MODEL FITS. If the data is large or if nstart is large, then setting titbits=TRUE may give users problems with memory. It is more efficient, from a memory perspective, to refit the "best" model using regimix(qv) after identifying it with regimix.multifit(qv). See examples for illustration about how to do this.}

\item{power}{a numeric vector (length either 1 or the number of species) defining the power parameter to use in the Tweedie models. If length(power)==1, then the same power parameter is used for all species. If length(power)==No_species, then each species gets its own power parameter. Power values must be between 1 and 2, for computational reasons they should be well away from the boundary. The default is 1.6 as this has proved to be a good ball-park value for the fisheries data that the developer has previously analysed.}

\item{nstart}{for regional_mix.multifit only. The number of random starts to perform for re-fitting. Default is 10, which will need increasing for serious use.}

\item{mc.cores}{for regional_mix.multifit only. The number of cores to spread the re-fitting over.}

\item{alpha}{Numeric vector of length S. Specifies the mean prevalence for each species, on the logit scale}

\item{S}{Integer giving the number of species}

\item{n}{Integer giving the number of observations (sites)}

\item{p.x}{Integer giving the number of covariates (including the intercept) for the model for the latent RCP types}

\item{p.w}{Integer giving the number of covariates (excluding the intercept) for the model for the species data}

\item{tau}{Numeric matrix of dimension c(nRCP-1,S). Specifies each species difference from the mean to each RCPs mean for the first nRCP-1 RCPs. The last RCP means are calculated using the sum-to-zero constraints}

\item{beta}{Numeric matrix of dimension c(nRCP-1,p.x). Specifies the RCP's dependence on the covariates (in X)}

\item{gamma}{Numeric matrix of dimension c(n,p.w). Specifies the species' dependence on the covariates (in W)}

\item{logDisps}{Logartihm of the (over-)dispersion parameters for each species for negative binomial, Tweedie and Normal models}

\item{powers}{Power parameters for each species for Tweedie model}

\item{X}{Numeric matrix of dimension c(n,p.x). Specifies the covariates for the RCP model. Must include the intercept, if one is wanted. Default is random numbers in a matrix of the right size.}

\item{W}{Numeric matrix of dimension c(n,p.w). Specifies the covariates for the species model. Must not include the intercept. Unless you want it included twice. Default is to give random levels of a two-level factor.}

\item{dist}{Text string. Specifies the distribution of the species data. Current options are "bernoulli" (default), "poisson", "negative_binomial", "tweedie" and "gaussian.}

\item{nRCP}{Integer giving the number of RCPs}

\item{offset}{Numeric vector of size n. Specifies any offset to be included into the species level model.}

\description{
creates an \code{regional_mix} model.

The randomised quantile residuals ("RQR", from Dunn and Smyth, 1996) are defined by their marginal distribution function (marginality is over #' other species observations within that site; see Foster et al, in prep). The result is one residual per species per site and they all should be standard
normal variates. Within a site they are likely to be correlated (as they share a common latent factor), but across sampling locations they will be independent.
 The deviance residuals (as used here), are actually just square root of minus two times the log-likelihood contribution for each sampling location. We do #' not subtract the log-likelihood of the saturated model as, at the time of writing, we are unsure what this log-likelihood should be (latent factors confuse #' things here). This implies that the residuals will not have mean zero and their variance might also be heteroskedastic. This was not realised when writing #' the original RCP paper (Foster et al, 2013), obviously. We still believe that these residuals have some utility, but we are unsure where that utility stops. #' For general useage, the "RQR" residuals should probably be preferred.
