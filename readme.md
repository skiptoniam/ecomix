ecomix is a package to implement statisitical models on multivariate
species data. Two main type of finite mixture models are avaliable which
either model at species level (Species Archetype Models) or site level
(Region of Common Profile).

#### Installation

`ecomix` is currently under development.

A version can be installed from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

``` r
devtools::install_github('skiptoniam/ecomix')
library(ecomix)
```
